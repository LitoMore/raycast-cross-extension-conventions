# Raycast Cross-Extension Conventions

Defines the development approach for cross-extension in Raycast

![raycast-cross-extension-badge]

## Background

Raycast has tons of extensions so far. But most of them are standalone, itâ€™s hard to use their ability from other extensions.

## Install

```shell
npm i raycast-cross-extension
```

## Usages

### Consumer Usage

Add your target extension handle to the `crossExtensions` list of package.json.
This field allows providers to get to know who is using their extension. See [maintenance](#maintenance).

```json
{
	"crossExtensions": ["target-extensions-author-name/target-extension-name"]
}
```

You may need to catch exceptions from `launchCommand()` if the target command is not installed.
The [`open()`](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/utilities#open) redirects to the Store when `launchCommand()` errored.

#### Example

```typescript
import { LaunchType } from "@raycast/api";
import { crossLaunchCommand } from "raycast-cross-extension";

crossLaunchCommand(
	{
		name: "target-command-name",
		type: LaunchType.UserInitiated,
		extensionName: "target-extension-name",
		ownerOrAuthorName: "target-extension-author-name",
		context: {
			foo: "foo",
			bar: "bar",
		},
	},
	{
		ownerOrAuthorName: "your-extension-author-name",
	},
).catch(() => {
	open(
		"raycast://extensions/target-extension-author-name/target-extension-name",
	);
});
```

### Provider Usage

Incoming parameters can be received from [`LaunchContext`](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/command#launchcontext).

The `callbackLaunchOptions` is used for running the callback `launchCommand()` to the source extension.

Please note passing parameters through [`Arguments`](https://developers.raycast.com/information/lifecycle/arguments) is not recommneded since it supports string only.

#### Example

```typescript
import { open, LaunchProps } from "@raycast/api";
import { callbackLaunchCommand, LaunchOptions } from "raycast-cross-extension";

type LaunchContext = {
	foo?: string;
	bar?: string;
	callbackLaunchOptions?: LaunchOptions;
};

export default function Command({
	launchContext = {},
}: LaunchProps<{ launchContext?: LaunchContext }>) {
	const { foo, bar, callbackLaunchOptions } = launchContext;
	// ...
	callbackLaunchCommand(callbackLaunchOptions, {
		result: "hello, world",
	});
}
```

## API

### crossLaunchCommand(options, callbackOptions)

#### options

Type: `LaunchOptions`

Options for launch the target command.

#### callbackOptions

Type: `Partial<LaunchOptions>`

Options for launch the callback command. It will be used in the callback stage. You can only pass in `ownerOrAuthorName` here.
The `name` defaults to `environment.commandName`, `type` defaults to `LaunchType.UserInitiated`, and `extensionName` defaults to `environment.extensionName`.

### callbackLaunchCommand(options, payload)

#### options

Type: `LaunchOptions`

Pass in `launchContext.callbackLaunchOptions`. This is used to load options for callback.

#### payload

Type: `LaunchOptions['context']`

Context data for sending back to consumer command.

## Maintenance

When you make breaking changes, keep an eye out for other projects using your API.

You can search for your extension handle `your-author-name/your-extension-name` from the [raycast/extension](https://github.com/raycast/extensions) to find that extension using your extension.

## Badges

Show the world your extension implemented Cross-Extension.
